    "In the previous notebook, we developed a solution for various types of files and data formats commonly found in organizations, and this covers big majority of the use cases. However, you will find that there are issues when dealing with questions that require answers from complex files. The complexity of these files arises from their length and the way information is distributed within them. Large documents are always a challenge for Search Engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "One example of such complex files is Technical Specification Guides or Product Manuals, which can span hundreds of pages and contain information in the form of images, tables, forms, and more. Books are also complex due to their length and the presence of images or tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "These files are typically in PDF format. To better handle these PDFs, we need a smarter parsing method that treats each document as a special source and processes them page by page (1 page = 1 chunk). The objective is to obtain more accurate and faster answers from our system. Fortunately, there are usually not many of these types of documents in an organization, allowing us to make exceptions and treat them differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your use case is just PDFs, for example, you can just use [PyPDF library](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) or [Azure AI Document Intelligence SDK (former Form Recognizer)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview?view=doc-intel-3.0.0), vectorize using OpenAI API and push the content to a vector-based index. And this is problably the simplest and fastest way to go.  However if your use case entails connecting to a datalake, or Sharepoint libraries or any other document data source with thousands of documents with multiple file types and that can change dynamically, then you would want to use the Ingestion and Document Cracking and AI-Enrichment capabilities of Azure Search engine, Notebooks 1-3, and avoid a lot of painful custom code. \n"

      "The differences between the mindsets and actions of the \"rich dad\" and the \"poor dad\" in Robert Kiyosaki's \"Père riche, père pauvre\" are quite pronounced and can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Attitude Towards Money**: The rich dad views money as a tool that can work for him, whereas the poor dad believes that money is something to be earned through hard work. The rich dad teaches that \"money works for you\" whereas the poor dad thinks \"you work for money\" [[6]](https://blobstorageixqo5iaqmpzwc.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Financial Education**: The rich dad emphasizes the importance of financial education and understanding how money works. He believes that learning about money management and investments is crucial for wealth creation. In contrast, the poor dad focuses on traditional education and securing a stable job, believing that good grades will lead to a good job [[6]](https://blobstorageixqo5iaqmpzwc.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Investment and Assets**: The rich dad teaches the importance of acquiring assets that generate income, while the poor dad considers his home as the most significant investment. The rich dad understands the difference between assets and liabilities, emphasizing that true wealth comes from accumulating assets that produce cash flow [[5]](https://blobstorageixqo5iaqmpzwc.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Mindset and Language**: The rich dad encourages a mindset that focuses on possibilities and opportunities, teaching his children to ask, \"How can I afford this?\" instead of saying, \"I can't afford this,\" which limits thinking. The poor dad, however, often expresses limitations regarding money [[6]](https://blobstorageixqo5iaqmpzwc.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Risk and Fear**: The rich dad teaches how to manage risks and leverage them for opportunity, while the poor dad tends to avoid risks and focuses on job security [[6]](https://blobstorageixqo5iaqmpzwc.blob.core.windows.net/books/Pere_Riche_Pere_Pauvre.pdf).\n",
