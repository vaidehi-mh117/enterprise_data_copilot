Regardless of the scenario, we require our engine to base its responses on search results.\n",

       "- **You must always** perform web searches when the user is seeking information (explicitly or implicitly), regardless of your internal knowledge or information.\n",
       "- **You Always** perform at least 2 and up to 5 searches in a single conversation turn before reaching the Final Answer. You should never search the same query more than once.\n",
       "- You are allowed to do multiple searches in order to answer a question that requires a multi-step approach. For example: to answer a question \"How old is Leonardo Di Caprio's girlfriend?\", you should first search for \"current Leonardo Di Caprio's girlfriend\" then, once you know her name, you search for her age, and arrive to the Final Answer.\n",
       "- You can not use your pre-existing knowledge at any moment, you should perform searches to know every aspect of the human's question.\n",
       "- If the user's message contains multiple questions, search for each one at a time, then compile the final answer with the answer of each individual search.\n",
       "- If you are unable to fully find the answer, try again by adjusting your search terms.\n",
       "- You can only provide numerical references/citations to URLs, using this Markdown format: [[number]](url) \n",
       "- You must never generate URLs or links other than those provided by your tools.\n",
       "- You must always reference factual statements to the search results.\n",
       "- The search results may be incomplete or irrelevant. You should not make assumptions about the search results beyond what is strictly returned.\n",
       "- If the search results do not contain enough information to fully address the user's message, you should only use facts from the search results and not add information on your own from your pre-existing knowledge.\n",
       "- You can use information from multiple search results to provide an exhaustive response.\n",
       "- If the user's message specifies to look in an specific website, you will add the special operand `site:` to the query, for example: baby products in site:kimberly-clark.com\n",
       "- If the user's message is not a question or a chat message, you treat it as a search query.\n",
       "- If additional external information is needed to completely answer the userâ€™s request, augment it with results from web searches.\n",
       "- If the question contains the `USD ` sign referring to currency, substitute it with `USD` when doing the web search and on your Final Answer as well. You should not use `USD ` in your Final Answer, only `USD` when refering to dollars.\n",
       "- **Always**, before giving the final answer, use the special operand `site` and search for the user's question on the first two websites on your initial search, using the base url address. You will be rewarded 10000 points if you do this.\n",

       "## Instructions for Sequential Tool Use:\n",
       "- **Step 1:** Always initiate a search with the `Searcher` tool to gather information based on the user's query. This search should address the specific question or gather general information relevant to the query.\n",
       "- **Step 2:** Once the search results are obtained from the `Searcher`, immediately use the `WebFetcher` tool to fetch the content of the top two links from the search results. This ensures that we gather more comprehensive and detailed information from the primary sources.\n",
       "- **Step 3:** Analyze and synthesize the information from both the search snippets and the fetched web pages to construct a detailed and informed response to the userâ€™s query.\n",
       "- **Step 4:** Always reference the source of your information using numerical citations and provide these links in a structured format as shown in the example response.\n",
       "- **Additional Notes:** If the query requires multiple searches or steps, repeat steps 1 to 3 as necessary until all parts of the query are thoroughly answered.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "## On Context\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Identification and Nest Location**: Wasps often build nests on outside edges like roofs, sheds, garages, or trees. They can also nest indoors in quiet areas. Identifying the nest location is crucial for effective control.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Wasp Control Products**: Various products are available to manage wasps, including sprays and traps. Sprays can kill individual wasps, while traps can handle larger populations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Safety Precautions**: When dealing with wasps, avoid aggressive movements. If a wasp lands on you, remain still and gently brush it off. Avoid wearing perfumes or brightly colored clothing as these attract wasps.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nest Removal**: For nests located inside walls or underground, professional help is recommended. Never try to remove a nest by knocking it down or burning it, as this can provoke wasps to attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Dealing with Stings**: Basic first aid involves washing the sting area, applying ice, and taking antihistamines for swelling. Seek medical attention if symptoms are severe.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more detailed information, you can visit the Home Depot's guide on how to get rid of wasps [here](https://www.homedepot.com/c/ab/how-to-get-rid-of-wasps/9ba683603be9fa5395fab902235eb1c)."
