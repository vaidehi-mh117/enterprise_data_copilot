    "1. **Notebook 13:** How to deploy a backend API using **Azure Bot Service**.  \n",
    "2. **Notebook 14:** How to interact with the Bot Service API programmatically using **POST requests**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Azure Bot Service: Pros and Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ **Pros:**\n",
    "- Seamless integration with multiple communication channels (O365 emails, MS Teams, web chat, etc.).\n",
    "- Comprehensive **Python SDKs** with utilities like typing indicators, proactive messages, and file uploads.\n",
    "- Built-in **authentication** and **logging mechanisms**.\n",
    "- SDK support for **Python**, **JavaScript**, and **.NET**.\n",
    "- Integration with **Application Insights Service** for monitoring.\n",
    "- Backed by **Microsoft's support and product teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚ùå **Cons:**\n",
    "- No support for **streaming**.\n",
    "- Lack of **private endpoint** support.\n",
    "- Cannot be containerized or run on **Kubernetes** or **container apps**.\n",
    "- Steeper **learning curve** for mastering its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why FastAPI?**\n",
    "To address these limitations, we‚Äôll build a **self-contained Backend API using FastAPI**. This backend will:\n",
    "- Be containerizable (e.g., using Docker).\n",
    "- Deployable on any platform supporting containers.\n",
    "- Allow flexibility and easier integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will zip the code and upload it to a new slot in the same Azure Web App service where the BotService API resides."
