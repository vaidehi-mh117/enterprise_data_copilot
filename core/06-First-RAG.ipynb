Simple example: an Agent might not have the inherent capability to reliably perform mathematical calculations by itself. However, we can introduce an expert - in this case a calculator, an expert at mathematical calculations. Now, when we need to perform a calculation, the Agent can call in the expert rather than trying to predict the result itself.

    "> This is one definition of an agent: an agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. Unlike a chain, an agent gives an LLM some degree of control over the sequence of steps in the application. Examples of using an LLM to decide the control of an application:\n",

It is generally accepted that membrane fusion occurs when the vesicle and target membranes are brought into close proximity by SNAREs and SM proteins. In this work, we demonstrate that, for fusion to occur, membrane bilayers must be destabilized by a conserved membrane-embedded motif located at the juxtamembrane region of the vesicle-anchored v-SNARE. Comprised of basic and hydrophobic residues, the juxtamembrane motif perturbs the lipid bilayer structure and promotes SNARE-SM-mediated membrane fusion. The juxtamembrane motif can be functionally substituted with an unrelated membrane-disrupting peptide in the membrane fusion reaction. These findings establish the juxtamembrane motif of the v-SNARE as a membrane-destabilizing peptide. Requirement of membrane-destabilizing peptides is likely a common feature of biological membrane fusion.\"}]\n",

The pathogeny of COVID-19 in TCM is damp-toxin, with the core pathogenesis of damp-toxin retention in lung and Qi repression. Its pathological features can be summarized as \\\"damp, toxin, obstruction, deficiency\\\". The location of the disease is lung, always involving spleen and stomach, and may further affect heart and kidney in severe cases. The major treatments for each course are Fanghua Shizuo, Xuanfei Touxie(early stage); Qingre Jiedu, Xuanxie Feire(middle stage); Kaibi Gutuo, Huiyang Jiuni(severe stage); Qingjie Yure, Yiqi Yangyin(recovery stage).

LANCET figured out that the 2019-nCoV is closely related to \\\"cytokine storm\\\". \\\"Cytokine storm\\\" is an excessive immune response of the body to external stimuli such as viruses and bacteria. As the virus attacking the body, it stimulates the secretion of a large number of inflammatory factors: interleukin(IL), interferon(IFN), C-X-C motif chemokine(CXCL) and so on, which lead to cytokine cascade reaction. With the exudation of inflammatory factors, cytokines increase abnormally in tissues and organs, interfering with the immune system, causing excessive immune response of the body, resulting in diffuse damage of lung cells, pulmonary fibrosis, and multiple organ damage, even death. Arachidonic acid(AA) metabolic pathway is principally used to synthesize inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemotactic protein 1(MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor(TNF), IL, IFN, etc., which is closely related to the occurrence, development and regression of inflammation. Therefore, the inhibition of AA metabolism pathway is benefit for inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors in the body and alleviating the \\\"cytokine storm\\\". Based on the pharmacophore models of the targets on AA metabolic pathway, the traditional Chinese medicine database 2009(TCMD 2009) was screened. The potential herbs were ranked by the number of hit molecules, which were scored by pharmacophore fit value. In the end, we obtained the potential active prescriptions on \\\"cytokine storm\\\" according to the potential herbs in the \\\"National novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan(trial version sixth)\\\". The results showed that the hit components with the inhibitory effect on AA were magnolignan \\u2160, lonicerin and physcion-8-O-\\u03b2-D-glucopy-ranoside, which mostly extracted from Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Zingiberis Rhizoma Recens, Lonicerae Japonicae Flos, Rhei Radix et Rhizoma, Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Scutellariae Radix, Gardeniae Fructus, Ginseng Radix et Rhizoma, Arctii Fructus, Dryopteridis Crassirhizomatis Rhizoma, Paeoniaeradix Rubra, Dioscoreae Rhizoma.

This novel coronavirus disease phenotype ranges from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant cytokine storm with respiratory failure, polyorgan dysfunction, and death. Severe disease is characterized by exuberant inflammation resulting from high circulating cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). These inflammatory mediators are responsible for the detrimental effects on the immune, hematologic, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal and other body systems. In addition to inhibition of viral replication, blunting this inflammatory response before overt cytokine storm is important to improve outcomes. Although there are upcoming promising agents such as remdesivir and convalescent plasma, inexpensive, safe, and widely available adjunct treatments to ameliorate disease burden would be welcome.

Ross is trying to direct the movement of the couch by repeatedly yelling \"Pivot!\" to indicate that they need to turn the couch to fit it around the corner. However, the situation becomes increasingly frustrating as the couch gets stuck, and Ross's repeated shouting of \"Pivot!\" becomes more frantic. Chandler eventually responds with frustration, telling Ross to \"Shut up!\" The scene is comedic due to the absurdity of the situation and Ross's insistence on using the word \"pivot\" as if it would solve the problem [[3]](https://blobstorageixqo5iaqmpzwc.blob.core.windows.net/friends/s05/e16/c10.txt?sv=2022-11-02&ss=b&srt=sco&sp=rltfx&se=2026-01-02T09:04:19Z&st=2025-01-02T01:04:19Z&spr=https&sig=q%2FjY9R25rdc%2BIH1iiq1uPIBm82xECsN9d%2B2ftdM1SJI%3D)."

    "- **Important Note**: Agents give the LLM some degree of control over the sequence of steps in the application, allowing for more flexible and dynamic decision-making. However, while this provides more adaptability, it can sometimes lead the model to incorporate prior knowledge rather than strictly responding based on the context provided. Chains, on the other hand, are more rigid but offer a higher degree of reliability. We will address this issue in future notebooks."
